**IMPLEMENTATION TESTING**

## Postman API Testing

To facilitate API testing for the Staff Allocations App, a Postman collection has been prepared. The collection contains pre-built requests for all major endpoints, including user authentication, course management, staff management, and staff allocations.

### Tested Collection Package:
The tested collection package , `Staff_Allocation_API_Collection.postman_test_run.json`, has been uploaded to the repository.

### Postman Collection Link:
You can also access the Postman collection directly via the following link:

[Staff Allocations API Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/tramdeo816034662/workspace/staff-allocations-api-testing/collection/33339653-cd129fa5-485e-437b-ba77-23b8be33ff62?action=share&creator=33339653&active-environment=33339653-3547a9b0-c024-4a10-93ed-b816c0f59a13)

This collection includes all the necessary API requests to test the application's functionality through Postman, allowing you to interact with the API in a structured way.

Hereâ€™s an updated section for your `README.md` on how Integration Tests and Unit Tests were implemented and handled:

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are designed to test individual components of the application in isolation. The tests for the application cover the following functionalities:

- **User Management**: Tests for creating, authenticating, updating, and retrieving users.
- **Staff Management**: Tests for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving staff members.
- **Course Management**: Tests for creating, updating, and deleting courses.
- **Staff Allocation**: Tests for assigning staff to courses and viewing allocated staff.

Each test case ensures that the respective functions behave as expected, verifying the correctness of both input and output.

### Integration Tests
Integration tests check the interaction between different components of the application. These tests focus on the following aspects:

- **Database Interactions**: Validating that the application properly creates, updates, and deletes records in the database.
- **Functionality Workflow**: Ensuring that the different controllers and models work together seamlessly, such as user authentication and staff allocation processes.

The integration tests use an in-memory SQLite database, allowing for fast execution without affecting the production database. Each test runs within a test context, where the database is set up and torn down before and after each test.

### Running the Tests
To run the tests in the terminal, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest App/tests/
```

This command will discover and run all tests in the `App/tests/` directory, providing a summary of passed and failed tests.
